# Human Learning Analytics

## Description

An experiment was conducted at CERV by Anais Raison, a doctoral student in cognitive psychology, where participants had to learn to solve a 3D puzzle (Soma cube) in a Virtual Environment for Human Learning (VEHL), following instructions displayed on a panel. The resolution is ordered; each puzzle piece must be selected and positioned in a specific order. Participants repeated this task a certain number of times until they fully mastered the puzzle resolution. Each repetition is called a trial. For each trial, behavioral data such as the number of instruction consultations, the number of piece manipulations, etc., were recorded while participants performed the task.

## Jupyter Notebooks

- `human-learning-analytics.ipynb`: The goal is to develop an AI capable of predicting the learning progression of a participant based on their behavior during different trials.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- See the `requirements.txt` file for specific project dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:fabricioalves206/human-learning-project
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd human-learning-project
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Navigate to the analysis notebook (`human-learning-analytics.ipynb`).
3. Execute the notebook cells as needed.
